# Project Title
Online Store
## Description of the Project

The purpose of the application is to let users view products, add or remove items from a cart, and complete a checkout.

## User Stories

List the user stories that guided the development of your application. Format these stories as: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

As a customer, I want to add a product to my cart by entering its ID so that I can collect the items I want to purchase.

As a customer, I want to view the contents of my cart so that I can see which products I’ve selected and their prices.

As a customer, I want to remove a product from my cart by entering its ID so that I can update my selection before checking out.

As a customer, I want to see the total amount of my cart so that I know how much I need to pay at checkout.

As a customer, I want to check out by confirming my purchase and entering a cash amount so that I can complete my order.

As a customer, I want to receive a printed receipt with the change and all items listed so that I have proof of my purchase.

As a customer, I want the shopping cart to be cleared after checkout so that I can start a new order from a clean state if I want to shop again.
## Setup

Instructions on how to set up and run the project using IntelliJ IDEA.
I open IntelliJ and start a new Java project, then I name the project, right-click the src folder, and create a new Java class. I paste my code into that file. If I’m using a CSV file like transactions.csv, I make sure it’s in the project folder or fix the path in the code. After that, I just hit the green play button or right-click the file and run it—the app shows up in the terminal at the bottom.
### Prerequisites

- IntelliJ IDEA: Ensure you have IntelliJ IDEA installed, which you can download from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
- Java SDK: Make sure Java SDK is installed and configured in IntelliJ.

### Running the Application in IntelliJ

Follow these steps to get your application running within IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Select "Open" and navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the project.
3. After the project opens, wait for IntelliJ to index the files and set up the project.
4. Find the main class with the `public static void main(String[] args)` method.
5. Right-click on the file and select 'Run 'YourMainClassName.main()'' to start the application.

## Technologies Used
