## User Stories

List the user stories that guided the development of your application. Format these stories as: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

- As a user, I want to be able to input my data, so that the application can process it accordingly.
- As a user, I want to receive immediate feedback, so I can understand what to do next.
- As a customer I should have a home screen with multiple options so that add deposit, make payments, Ledger, and a Exit.
- As a customer I want to add a deposit to my account so that I can save and keep track
- As a customer I want to make a payment so that I'm able to keep track and purchase items
- As a customer I want to be able to see the ledger screen So that I can see all entries deposits payments and reports
- As a customer I want to look at the ledger screen and view reports so that a new screen will allow the user to run pre-defined reports or to run a custom search
- As a customer I want to be able to do this to exit the program so that after I'm finished I can put away the application
## Setup

Instructions on how to set up and run the project using IntelliJ IDEA.
I open IntelliJ and start a new Java project, then I name the project, right-click the src folder, and create a new Java class. I paste my code into that file. If I’m using a CSV file like transactions.csv, I make sure it’s in the project folder or fix the path in the code. After that, I just hit the green play button or right-click the file and run it—the app shows up in the terminal at the bottom.
### Prerequisites

- IntelliJ IDEA: Ensure you have IntelliJ IDEA installed, which you can download from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
- Java SDK: Make sure Java SDK is installed and configured in IntelliJ.

Follow these steps to get your application running within IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Select "Open" and navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the project.
3. After the project opens, wait for IntelliJ to index the files and set up the project.
4. Find the main class with the `public static void main(String[] args)` method.
5. Right-click on the file and select 'Run 'YourMainClassName.main()'' to start the application.
